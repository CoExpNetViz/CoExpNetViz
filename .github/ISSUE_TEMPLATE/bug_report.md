  - The files created in the output directory. Or if there are none, please mention that.
  - The input files you provided
  - [The cytoscape log](https://cytoscape.org/common_issues.html#loginfo). Alternatively, include the task history (click the button in the lower left of Cytoscape, the one with tooltip "Show tasks", it's either a hamburger menu or an error/warning icon) as a file named `task_history.txt`.

Feel free to redact file contents with `[redacted]` for bits you don't want to share, so long as the issue can still be reproduced with the input files.
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
